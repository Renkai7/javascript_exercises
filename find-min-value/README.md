# Linear Search Exercise: Find the Minimum Value

This exercise is designed to help beginners practice linear search, a fundamental algorithm used for searching for specific elements in an array. In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript function to find the minimum value in an array of numbers using linear search.

## Exercise Objective

The main objective of this exercise is to create a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the minimum value found in the array. You should implement the function without using built-in array functions like `Math.min` or `Array.prototype.reduce`. Instead, you will use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and compare each element to find the smallest one.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `findMinValue` function:

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 2];
const min = findMinValue(numbers);
console.log(`The minimum value in the array is: ${min}`);
```
